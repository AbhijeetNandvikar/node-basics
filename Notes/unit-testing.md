### Important points

- One of the most common usecases for Node.js is writing test for Node.js and Frontend apps. Because Node.js can run outside the browser, it's perfect for CI environments and testing automations.

- Unit test will test little chunks of your code in isolation to ensure they behave has intended. Node.js ships with the assert module. This module gives us so many utilities that allow us to create expectations of on our code. When those expectations aren't met, assert will throw an error telling us why. This is perfect for testing!. Most testing framework for node are built in this assert module.
